We will explore portfolio returns and risk using historical price data for AMZN, IGLB, and SPY from 2014 to 2019.

Tasks include:
*   We'll normalize IGLB's 'Close' and 'Adj Close' prices to compare their performance.
*   We'll filter and merge the adjusted closing prices for all three securities.
*   We'll calculate log returns, plot cumulative NAV lines, and analyze summary statistics.
*   We'll examine correlations, calculate Sharpe ratios, and speculate on optimal portfolios.
*   Using Monte Carlo simulations, we'll generate an efficient frontier to identify optimal portfolios based on risk and return.
